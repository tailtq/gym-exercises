        "<strong>It plays an important role in body power and strength increase:</strong> Since pull-up is a compound exercise, it works the muscles in the upper body in perfect harmony. The pull-up exercise performed at body weight supports general body strength and core strength. It provides a stronger and more solid body.",
        "<strong>Provides cardiovascular benefits:</strong> Pull-ups increase your heart rate. When this type of exercise is done quickly and with no rest periods in between, it provides a great cardiovascular workout as well as the ability to develop strength.",

        "<strong>Pull-up up makes your arms stronger:</strong> If you cannot do the pull-up exercise, this is probably an indication that your arms are weak. Arms and wrists work actively in all types of pull-ups. The strength of the arms increases more each time you lift the body weight. Increasing the number of pull-ups means the development and strengthening of your arms.",
        "<strong>It develops wing muscles:</strong> It is effective in working and shaping the parts of the body, which are located in the right and left upper parts and which are called wing muscles. If you want a V-taper body, you can have it with a pull-up motion."

In this exercise, the palms are faced towards the body. Chin-ups may be an easier move for beginners than pull-ups.",
        "Chin-up is a closed-chain an exercise that works almost all of the muscle groups on the upper body and provides both hypertrophy and strength at body weight. The focus of the chin-ups exercise is on the back and biceps muscles. It is one of the most effective exercises to develop and strengthen the back and wing muscles.",

The chin-up exercise performed at body weight supports general body strength and core strength. It provides a stronger and more solid body.",

        "<strong>Increases grip strength:</strong> When you hold an object in your daily life, it allows you to grasp it more firmly. For example; You can feel this even when opening a jar.",
        "<strong>Chin-up up makes your arms stronger:</strong> If you cannot do the chin-up exercise, this is probably an indication that your arms are weak. Arms and wrists work actively in all types of chin-ups. The strength of the arms increases more each time you lift the body weight. Increasing the number of chin-ups means the development and strengthening of your arms.",
        "<strong>It develops wing muscles:</strong> It is effective in working and shaping the parts of the body, which are located in the right and left upper parts and which are called wing muscles. If you want a V-taper body, you can have it with a chin-up motion."

        "Provides calorie burning: The bicycle crunch exercise is a more intense movement compared to other sit-ups. Compound exercises are exercises that work the muscles of two or more joints in your body. Basically, multiple muscles work together to perform a movement. This approach is effective because you can train more than one muscle at the same time. Doing compound exercises is more beneficial than isolation exercises. With compound movements, more muscle is used, which means more energy is spent and ultimately more fat is burned."

        "<strong>The Single leg press, is a type of strength training exercise.</strong> It\u2019s an effective move for strengthening your quadriceps, which are in the front of your upper legs. If you have a muscular imbalance or one leg is weaker than the other, the single leg press is a one-sided isolated exercise used to develop leg muscles.",
        "<strong>Provides volume increase in legs</strong>. If your goal is to add volume to your legs, leg press is one of the best leg exercises that focus solely on the big leg muscles.",
        "<strong>It is suitable for beginners.</strong> Since this exercise is done on a machine and while doing this you don\u2019t need to focus on your balancing muscles, it allows you to add more weight to gain more muscle.",
        "<strong>It increases growth hormone and testosterone levels.</strong> Studies show that both Leg press and Squat increase testosterone, growth hormone and cortisol levels, but squat exercise increases by 16.7% more than leg press exercise.",
        "It can help you increase hip and knee strength so you can do exercises like leg press, squats and deadlifts better.",
        "Leg press can help increase your speed and ability to accelerate. Moving fast requires your legs to build enough force to push your body forward. The more force you create, the further you move with each step. Exercising leg exercises, such as leg presses for power and strength, will benefit your stamina and strength so you can run faster."

        "This exercise is one of the most functional and effective exercises you can do. Turkish get-ups work major muscle groups across your entire body, including your glutes, traps, shoulders, lower-back muscles, core muscles, hamstrings, triceps, lats, and calves.",
        "When performing the Turkish get-ups muscles are worked throughout the entire body. It uses every main muscle group and it trains both mobility and stability in several joints and through varying positions. The Turkish Get-up is an exercise that develops stability and mobility throughout the body, in particular the shoulders and hips. Using the stabiliser muscles to steer your body around an overhead weight gives you the mechanical advantage to be stronger. The real beauty of this exercise is that every muscle has to work with each other in order to complete the full movement. It is therefore an awesome strength builder."
